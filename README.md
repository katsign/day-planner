## *Description*

This simple browser application uses jQuery to access the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library and manipulate the timeblocks of a virtual day planner. When the user looks at the app during work day hours (9 AM to 5 PM in this case) the timeblocks in the past appear grey; the present, purple; and the future, tan. When an entry is made into a timeblock's textarea, an event listener runs a function to save that data to the local storage of the user's machine. The past saved entries will appear on window load unless replaced/cleared and re-saved.

When accessed from too small a screen, a media query in the stylesheet hides the main content and displays an error message.

## *Screenshots*

#### At the top of the screen, a jumbotron displays the current day and the time.

#### The screenshots below show the timeblocks colored based on the time 2:20pm. The program loops through the timeblocks and changes the class with jQuery, manipulating the colors to correspond to the time of day.
